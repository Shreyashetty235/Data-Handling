# Data-Handling

I created a sample table named Customers to demonstrate the operations.

What I did :
Insert records into a table using INSERT INTO
Handle missing values using NULL and DEFAULT
Modify data using UPDATE 
Remove data using DELETE also applied WHERE condition

Conculsion
Through this task, I learned how SQL handles missing values and how to safely manipulate data using conditional statements.
